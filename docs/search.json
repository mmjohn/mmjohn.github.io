At UT, I’m enrolled in the EEB Graduate Program and am a Graduate Fellow on the Biomedical Big Data Training Grant in the Department of Statistics and Data Science. Previously, I received a BS in Biology from the University of Kansas, where I conducted research in theoretical population genetics with Dr. Maria Orive.\nAs a computational evolutionary biologist, I am broadly interested in population genetics, statistical inference, and machine learning. My dissertation work primarily seeks to improve methods for evolutionary inference on biological sequence data, using both deep neural networks and statistical modeling.
