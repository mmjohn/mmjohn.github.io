## Bio

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/) at UT Austin, advised by [Dr. Claus Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/). As a computational evolutionary biologist, I'm broadly interested in population genomics, statistical inference, and machine learning. My dissertation work primarily seeks to improve methods for evolutionary inference on biological sequence data, using both deep neural networks and statistical modeling. My graduate education has included 3 years as a trainee on the [Biomedical Big Data Training Grant](https://stat.utexas.edu/biomedical-big-data-training-grant) in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.utexas.edu/). During my undergraduate at KU, I studied theoretical population genetics in the lab of [Dr. Maria Orive](https://orive.ku.edu/home).
